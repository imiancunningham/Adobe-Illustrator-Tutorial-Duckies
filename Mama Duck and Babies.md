# **Creating a Mama Duck with Babies Graphic**
Today we're making a graphic of a Mama duck with her babies. By following this tutorial, you will learn the fundamental tools Illustrator offers and create a finished artwork similar to this: (INSERT IMAGE)

Let's first set up our project. Click the blue `new file` button in the top left corner of the screen. A New Document window should appear. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122496390/213348532-04e9a731-2385-480a-b8c5-d82511462d79.png)
Here you can name your artwork, set the dimensions of the canvas, and more. For the color mode, choose `RGB` if you plan to keep your artwork on screens or `CMYK` if you plan to print it. (INSERT IMAGE) The Artboards setting allows you to created multiple canvases in one file. (INSERT IMAGE) If you want to use precise measurements on your artwork, you can change between pixels, centimeters, or inches as your unit measure. (INSERT IMAGE) Here are the settings I'll be using, but don't worry if yours aren't exactly the same: (INSERT IMAGE)


Starting with the Mama Duck, we'll make two circles for the body and the head. If you don't see the circle tool, it might be hidden under another shape tool. To find it, click and hold on whatever shape tool is on your toolbar and a drop-down of the other tools will appear.

To draw Mama Duck's neck, we'll use the pen tool. The pen tool can take a while to get used to, but it is very powerful for drawing curved lines. First we'll click on the large circle where we want the neck to start. Then as the line follows our cursor we click on where we want the neck to stop at the head, but don't let go! Now we drag the cursor so that the line curves. When you like how it's positioned, let go of the mouse clicker. Now we'll do the same for the other side. (VIDEO???)
